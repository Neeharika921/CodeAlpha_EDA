# CodeAlpha_EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle

## 📊 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to perform a detailed EDA on a diabetes-related dataset to:

- Understand the structure and distribution of variables
- Detect trends, patterns, and anomalies
- Test hypotheses using statistical methods
- Identify potential data issues and preprocessing needs

## 📁 Dataset used:
[Link to Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshalpatel3558/diabetes-prediction-dataset) and includes health indicators like:

- Age, BMI, Blood Pressure
- Fasting Blood Glucose
- Physical Activity Level
- Smoking and Alcohol consumption
- Gender, Ethnicity

## 🔍 Questions asked:
- What features are most related to diabetes markers (glucose, HbA1c)?
- Does BMI or waist circumference affect glucose levels?
- Are there lifestyle factors (activity, alcohol, smoking) influencing diabetes?
- Do age, sex, or ethnicity groups show differences?
- Are there anomalies or outliers in health metrics?

## 🧠 Key EDA Tasks Performed

- ✅ Asked meaningful questions about the dataset
- ✅ Explored data structure (columns, types, nulls)
- ✅ Visualized distributions and relationships using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- ✅ Identified trends and correlation between features
- ✅ Performed t-tests to validate statistical hypotheses
- ✅ Detected and cleaned inconsistencies in categorical features

## 📈 Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy (for statistical testing)

## 🔍 Highlights

- No strong correlation found between glucose levels and physical activity
- Data cleaning revealed category inconsistencies
- Age, BMI, and glucose levels showed significant variation by lifestyle factors.
